Description: 
        `Multiprocessing` is a package for the Python language which supports the
        spawning of processes using the API of the standard library's
        `threading` module. `multiprocessing` has been distributed in the standard
        library since python 2.6.
        
        Features:
        
        * Objects can be transferred between processes using pipes or
          multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.
        
        * Objects can be shared between processes using a server process or
          (for simple data) shared memory.
        
        * Equivalents of all the synchronization primitives in `threading`
          are available.
        
        * A `Pool` class makes it easy to submit tasks to a pool of worker
          processes.
