# Example where a pool of http servers share a single listening socket
#
# On Windows this module depends on the ability to pickle a socket
# object so that the worker processes can inherit a copy of the server
# object.  (We import `processing.reduction` to enable this pickling.)
#
# Not sure if we should synchronize access to `socket.accept()` method by
# using a process-shared lock -- does not seem to be necessary.
